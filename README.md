## Description

Users also have the opportunity to search for performers and find shows the want to attend, additionaly they have the opportunity to reach out to performers to book them and even pay for their services through the App. 

Users will be able to search through the app by location, performer, instrument and time to be able to find their desired performers

Performers are given the option to make accounts and post their content on their profiles, which users can see, but only performers have editing access. (if this is too difficult, then an alternative is needed)
