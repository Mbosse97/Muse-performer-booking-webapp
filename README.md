# Muse

## Description 
The following project aims to give a platform for performers to be able to post their upcoming shows and receive attention from local users. 

Users also have the opportunity to search for performers and find shows the want to attend, additionaly they have the opportunity to reach out to performers to book them and even pay for their services through the App. 

Users will be able to search through the app by location, performer, instrument and time to be able to find their desired performers

Performers are given the option to make accounts and post their content on their profiles, which users can see, but only performers have editing access. (if this is too difficult, then an alternative is needed)

There will be separate components of the webApp including
- Header (containing links to events component and profiles component and signin componenent)
- footer (With links for contacting, and miscellaneous details )
- homeimage (intend to experiment with some animated css)
- home content (text to introduce webapp)
- Events
- ProfilesHome
- ProfilesIndividual
- Event tiles
- profile information
- profile image

This webapp will use a graphQl Mongo database which will contain: 
- performer information
- event information 
- Enquiry information 
- 

What i expect the project to do?

Database structure?

List of Objects
- Artist (name, gender, location, contact details, gigs-Object)
- Gig(location, instrument, )

Planning to approach this project with a database first approach, creating the logic of the application first before implementing a ui to suite the necessary information.
